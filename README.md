# Maze maker
> the idea is simple - I saw no decent app for maze creating and solving, so I decided to do 1 myself.

## What I plan to create in the end
The app which allows user to choose start and finish points (later), as well as the size of the maze (1:1), then algorithm (now I will try to implement Wilson's algorithm, later I want to edit it a bit or 2). Then I will give user chance to solve the maze, and after solving, the path-fining-algorithm will show the fastest way possible.

# Timeline
## 04-2024
Started the project. Want to make at least the scratch of the program. 
 
from the start user see layout and text **Choose THE START**, and by moving mouse the place where user can start under mouse highlights, User is choosing by clicking, and then sees **Choose THE FINISH**. Same procedure as with the start, and then maze starts to generate itself - and shows it. then user navigates with WASD or arrows (all the way or user is painted with line), completes the maze and then algorithm shows the fastest possible solution.

I decided to start without choosing start and finish positions, to at least make a prototype.
