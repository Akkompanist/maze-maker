# Maze maker
> the idea is simple - I saw no decent app for maze creating and solving, so I decided to do 1 myself.

## What I plan to create in the end
The app which allows user to choose start and finish points, as well as the size of the maze (1:1), then algorithm (that's the tough part - because I found no real algorithm which I would like to implement, so I have to invent a bicycle now). Then I will give user chance to solve the maze, and after solving, the path-fining-algorithm will show the fastest way possible.

## Timeline

Started the project. Want to make at least the scratch of the program.
